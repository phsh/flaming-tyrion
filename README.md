==================================================

1) Initial thoughts.

I wonder what I will learn in the land of Tokyo.


==================================================

2) The Pre trip
The trip has begun. I'm heading to the Terminal 5 Arlanda... Sitting and coding on the train I'm early to the Terminal. An hour before all other traverlers will arrivie.
I'm alone on the train... Isn't anyone going this early abroad?
