This is the README.md FILE and it's pretty awesome

==================================================

1) Initial thoughts.

I wonder what I will learn in the land of Tokyo.


==================================================

2) The Pre trip
The trip has begun. I'm heading to the Terminal 5 Arlanda... Sitting and coding on the train I'm early to the Terminal. An hour before all other traverlers will arrivie.
I'm alone on the train... Isn't anyone going this early abroad?
Arrived at the airport.
Just managed to commit my changes before the trains closed. Alias is difficult to setup! :)

The checking. The Automate wasn't my fiend and I was helped by a NICE LADY at the counter. It is possible that some people are naturally nice. Found a red lounge area where the poweroutlets where freely availible. Who new that the red sofa corner was this nice at Arlanda...
Waiting for the rest of the crue.
