Night before travel
-------------------

Did pre-flight check in for the first time... Finally in the 21th century!

Late packing and late administration of all things travel.

Onward and upward. First time in Sri Lanka and even the first time in Qutar.

Added some more content...

Went to bed late.

Early morning with crying kids, sad that dad is leaving...

Took a cab to the train, first in of the group. Caught up with the group at Arlanda. Managed to pawn my extra 5000 LKR that I had by misstake to a fellow traveler.

Fast security unto the morning bar. A huge beer, and ran into TE with friends. After the beer it was off to the line unto the plane.

On the plane to Qatar, saw two movies, Jurassic World och Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, JW was okay and MI:RN was better. Ate Beef, the only meal opition availble, wouldn't have been an option in Sweden.
Slept a 30 minutes in the beginning of the flight.

Landed in Duho, a huge empty airport, tried to order some basic sandwich, but the attendent thought there wasn't any time before the flight. We had to order at a caf√©. The sandwich was okay for a airport food. We didn't know how much a Qatar money is worth, but apparently it wasn't too bad.

The flight to Colombo. Ate some okay Lamb rice thingy, it was okay. Took a beer and a conjac.
