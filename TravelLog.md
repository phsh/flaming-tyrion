This is the README.md FILE and it's pretty awesome

==================================================

1) Initial thoughts.

I wonder what I will learn in the land of Tokyo.


==================================================

2) The Pre trip
The trip has begun. I'm heading to the Terminal 5 Arlanda... Sitting and coding on the train I'm early to the Terminal. An hour before all other traverlers will arrivie.
I'm alone on the train... Isn't anyone going this early abroad?
Arrived at the airport.
Just managed to commit my changes before the trains closed. Alias is difficult to setup! :)

The checking-in. The Automate wasn't my fiend and I was helped by a NICE LADY at the counter. It is possible that some people are naturally nice. Found a red lounge area where the poweroutlets where freely availible. Who new that the red sofa corner was this nice at Arlanda...
Waiting for the rest of the crue.

After experiencing the red room of power outlets, I make the trek to the Passport/security line, I wait for zero minutes before I can put my stuff into the plastic tray. On the other side I randomly strol around until I find two happy travels that will join me to Tokyo. One is eating Hamburgers and I'm not the one to say know. MAX has open in Arlanda, and those burgers are GOOD. After some eating a fellow old friend have joined us, we discuss the merits of diffrent games to have on our laptops/devices.

We join the other group that has stopped at the Beer place. The group is complete for a few minutes, after which people went their seperate way. I'm left with my roomie and two other guys, they are planing the day we arriave. A cost-play event in Tokyo happens every Sunday, that is the thing that looks most promising. Sailermoon characters are promised... The Brooklyn lager was very good. We rush to make s short hello to the people that are of to Dubai, they are talking about iOS stuff. Interesting, but I want my HTML5/JS thingy.
I  make a short congratulations to the Red Socks dude... Fist bump!

Then I ran to my groups waterhole, and managed to take a pint of Brooklyn before it was time to board.

Writing this on the plane. There is a choice of Sandwich Chicken or Salad. I hope that I will get my Chicken one. 30 minutes to Kastup, that's the airport of Copenhagen. Beer awaits... 10 hours to a Costplay event! Weird.

Made some basic test to my hello world application. 
Had a glass of water. Thanks SAS! You are too kind...
Now going down for landing to Kastrup. My ears are making there presence known.

First leg
