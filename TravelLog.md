This is the Travel log for the trip that initiated this project.
==================================================

Initial thoughts
================
I wonder what I will learn in the land of Tokyo.

The Pre trip
===============
The trip has begun. I'm heading to the Terminal 5 Arlanda... Sitting and coding on the train I'm early to the Terminal. An hour before all other traverlers will arrivie.
I'm alone on the train... Isn't anyone going this early abroad?
Arrived at the airport.
Just managed to commit my changes before the trains closed. Alias is difficult to setup! :)

The checking-in. The Automate wasn't my fiend and I was helped by a NICE LADY at the counter. It is possible that some people are naturally nice. Found a red lounge area where the poweroutlets where freely availible. Who new that the red sofa corner was this nice at Arlanda...
Waiting for the rest of the crue.

After experiencing the red room of power outlets, I make the trek to the Passport/security line, I wait for zero minutes before I can put my stuff into the plastic tray. On the other side I randomly strol around until I find two happy travels that will join me to Tokyo. One is eating Hamburgers and I'm not the one to say know. MAX has open in Arlanda, and those burgers are GOOD. After some eating a fellow old friend have joined us, we discuss the merits of diffrent games to have on our laptops/devices.

We join the other group that has stopped at the Beer place. The group is complete for a few minutes, after which people went their seperate way. I'm left with my roomie and two other guys, they are planing the day we arriave. A cost-play event in Tokyo happens every Sunday, that is the thing that looks most promising. Sailermoon characters are promised... The Brooklyn lager was very good. We rush to make s short hello to the people that are of to Dubai, they are talking about iOS stuff. Interesting, but I want my HTML5/JS thingy.
I  make a short congratulations to the Red Socks dude... Fist bump!

Then I ran to my groups waterhole, and managed to take a pint of Brooklyn before it was time to board.

Writing this on the plane. There is a choice of Sandwich Chicken or Salad. I hope that I will get my Chicken one. 30 minutes to Kastup, that's the airport of Copenhagen. Beer awaits... 10 hours to a Costplay event! Weird.

Made some basic test to my hello world application. 
Had a glass of water. Thanks SAS! You are too kind...
Now going down for landing to Kastrup. My ears are making there presence known.

First leg: DONE, uneventful, no sandwich...

Pause in Copenhagen
===================
Talked a bit about the merits of clocks, then entusiast won. Went through another passport control, I'm still me.
Short walk until the last beer in Denmark, I got two of those. One was given to me by a kind soul. Discussions about the population in Tokyo, an export setteled that line of thought, none of our guides had that information. The beer was Carlsberg, the best beer in the world, probably not.


The flight to Nippon
====================
The normal safety guide had a bonus. "Please don't sleep in the aile." A new one.
One of the files that I was supposed to view was broken. Weird. I thought that USB-sticks where eternal! My roomie is sleeping already, and my bench buddy is watching Elasyum. I will be watching my The Daily Show as always. 
One short commit on the Flight and I will be happy...

The travel proceeds. We are over Helsinki...

Over the mighty land of Russia. Eaten the food of air. It was especial good given the normal state of the air food.

Interesting discussions with my lane buddy.

Just passed the Ural Mountains. I'm over Siberia...

On the map I can see Tokyo, still five hours left....
Sleept a bit.
Tried watching Ghost in a Shell, but couldn't get through it. The subtitles where too much.

Last hour of the flight, getting a sandwich after some hours of sleep and watching parts of Wolverine, but the now we are over the Ocean. Last stretch.
Tired. But not too bad.

Landing in Tokyo
================
Waiting for the tickets
------------------------
We got to the airport and after getting my finger prints the Passport control let me into the bagage claim. And once I saw my wifes beatiful red bag, I went through the customer control, I passed that too. I'm the man! Oh, I signed two papers for the possibility to stay in Japan for a week...
Our rice-leader(?) got us some ticket and we were of the (Two a:s, with an O above them, and three lines after). That place. On the train I ate some riceballs... Good, nothing more.

To the hotel and en exellent lunch experience.
----------------------------------------------
Our roomies got switch by the Hotel, nothing to worry about but still... We decided for a quick lunch since we had an appointment with the Manga-people. Found a crazy cheap place, and the food was excellent.

To the park and the missing Manga people
----------------------------------------
As the thing with Manga people was in the early morning, the experience of seeing that was not availible, we walked in the park instead of rushing of to a bar. The park and the temple was good and I'm glad that I got to see that. Alot of people were wearing Traditional Japanese cloths... Alot of playful children with elaborate costums.
After the park closed, we wondered the streets of shopping Tokyo, alot of people and alot of stuff. We tried finding a bar, we finally stoped at a Wolfgang Puck Express Bar. The beer was uneventful.

Back to the Hotel
-----------------
Subway back, we stoped at the weird gaming place. Reconning until we dare try it...

The restaurant experience
-------------------------
We had planed for a short dinner experience since everyone was tired. There was a traditional Japanese place around the corner. We managed to get a table and starting ordering like crazy, we very extreme novicies, but alot of food arrived. And once everyone was done, more food arriaved. The food was good, Sachimi, not for me, but since the table was ladled with food, I got my full, and we were of to seven-eleven. Found somethings that I wouldn't normally would eat... great stuff, cheap.

-------------------
Start of the course
===================
After some wired problems with travel. 
The Tokyo trafic was more difficult than expected. Alot of people on the Subway.

First lunch on our own. AMAZING!
We hade some problems ordering food, but managed somehow got the most amazing lunch. Boild food at the table, pork and scrimp. Schumi schumi. We learned how to prepare our food, once we left the place. 1200 yes. I laught until I cried about how we missed how we have eaten our food. The weird silver thing in the middle of the table was important.

*Schabo schabo* is the correct name for that food.

More lecture, alot of people was tired. I wasn't focused. The thing with the maybe-function was totally lost on me, and I believe that I won't be able to explain the Decorator-pattern funcionality.

After the lecture a nice Diplomat talked about the possibiliy to go Osaka, AND more importantly that the King would be there next Monday... I said that I would be back in Sweden then, I didn't bother to explain that I couldn't care less about the Kings whereabouts.

Once we left that, we treked around Rappungi for 30 minutes in search for a bar. Found one that served something... I dared try the Highball, an experience at least, but no more. 200 Yen was the losses, not worth it but an experience none the less. Next we wandered the streets until we found the Ant'n'Bee, that served craft beers. And the first I drank was a Perpel Sweet Potato Lagar. All things that shouldn't bee in the same sentence. It was a excellent beer, but bland and purple in color. Next it was the Super IPA IBU of 110, IBU is a scale of which one can rank beers bitterness. It was a great beer. Then I tried another IPA had a index of 65 an it was even better. Not too expencive, 900 a' beer. Another thing that was great at the Ant'n Bee was the free wifi. My friend and I tried Google Hangouts, don't see the point yet.

Once we got the knowledge about the time, we made it over the street, but we made an extra round the block, as we didn't understand the sign. The porn-pusher told us that it was right infront of us... Very nice of him.

The dinner was great I ate curry-nudles with some starter that arriaved as I ate the last piece of me real meal. Everything was great, but the food wasn't that mush better than the first lunch. Drank a couple of beers. We hade some minor difficultis ordering, but it could have been worse...

After dinner some of us tried sturrring up some action, but the walk until we found some action broke me. Once we arriaved to the action arrieved, three of us jumped on a subway home instead. Best choise ever!


Breakfast and more lecture (Day three)
======================================

After the lectures we went and Akasuka to see the old town. The Temple was pretty awesome, and I tried the fortune thing. 66 Bad Fortune, was the outcome. We walked around the Temple area and watched/photod all the parts of the Temple, once that was done we made our way towards a bar, but finding a bar was more difficult than we could imagine. We walked along the river an saw the SkyTree and took some photos of it and the moon, that was showing. After some more hunting of bars we finally found a place that served beer and sake for the group. Eight people is a huge group in Tokyo.

After the sake and beer was in our bellies, we had a reservation at the Korean barbecue, and we were very close.

Here we got to grill on the table, and one of the greatest meat-experiences I have ever partaken in. Kobe sushi.... The cold raw meat melted on the tongue. HIGH LIGHT! One of the group arriaved late, but our table had shown extreme constrants and left food for him. The service was amazing. I had to go to the bathroom, the waiter told me to sit down, he would call me once the bathroom was availible. Which he did! A rare event in other part of the world.

After dinner a small group was lost in Tokyo, me and two other guys, some mixup about what to do next, and we stopped somewhere for some drinks and those drinks became a epic Five Bar Night!


The five bar night! (Shinbashi)

	a) Almost empty bar, with fresh vegitables, sake
	b) Not sitting with the Japanese, sake
	c) Shouting at the tv with crazy japanese, sake, not soo much, was kind of saticified, more fun dancing with the people than drinking more. 
	d) Klondyke Highball: Whisky bar, beer and serano (Facebook), beer
	e) Icheru and Ayu, Last bar. (Facebook) beer

Back at the hotel at a very late hour, but in time for listening to the World Cup qualifier game. Sweden was close for a few minutes, but then the game ran away from us.

Day four (Tired)
================
Woke late and went slowly to the letures, got there precisly when we should eat lunch. We had heard of this fantastic Sushi, so we head there. The green haired man The Sushi Master was gonna do our sushi, but there wasn't any room for the whole group. The little lady showed us to the back room. Here there were room and nekkid art on the walls. There was also an recommendation from the Amabassdor of US. The sushi was eadible not much more... The GreenEaters had some problems ordering, according to the woman, Scrimp is a vegitable.

Back for the last back half. Went through the testing framework, and the teacher made a small demonstration of it's use.

Ate at the Pork-place. The beer was amazing, some red beligian beer 9% that was a high light as a beer experience, the food was amazing again. The poor vegitarians had to manage again, I got more pork because of my tableer was a veggie. 

After that the group was of to the bar accross the street "These" were we got to chose drinks from a platter. Two drinks at my table, but the other table had only one, since the service, while good was slow.

Then we were of to a specific bar. The Albatross bar. Everyone into different cabs, but the people in mine didn't know where we were going. And as I was about to call a friend, he called me and they had tried follow a cab, but that cab wasn't the cab they were looking for. My boss knew were we where heading... The Albtross bar was tiny, we couldn't fit into the small bars in Tokyo. We found another place. The Egypt bar with Robot dancing. Two beers and then we were bored with the Robot dancing. (There was a colorized button, that once pushed made the bartender move like a robot.)

After some walking around in that area, we got bored, and our Club-master told us that we needed to go to WOMB, and no argument there. Into a cab, and then we where of again. 

Day five (Post WOMB)
====================
Slow to get up, had cramp in my calfmuscles apparently I'm not 22 anymore.
Went to GeekLand for the experience. Found the Steve Jobs autobiografy as a Manga, and weird toys and trinkets.
While waiting for the late group. We took a drink in the lobby. Okay nothing more.
As our leader had done something to his foot we chose not to travel that far, and found a Steakhouse close by. Aussie Outback Steakhouse.
The waiter told us in perfekt english that she spoke no english... Apparently the japanese charachers can be read phoneticly. We tried ordering, and that went as expected some problems and a few waiters, but we managed. The Womb-gang drank a pitcher of Beer and a bottle of wine. After dinner we went to the Mango Tree bar, where we drank a few drinks, before I excused myself for some skypeing with Sweden.
After that I was supposed to join the Womb-gang, but my brain asked once if that was such a smart thing to do. And I answered no, and went to sleep instead.

Day six (Last day)
==================
Took a coffee in the lobby.
Boat trip.
Tried get up to the Skytree, big fail. Nice lunch with nice people.
Back trying find trinkets. The Akasaba(?) place had a lot stuff. Bought all that I could find, and I can find alot of stuff.
After that I wanted to see the Shibaya crossing, subway and then searching for 45 minutes, couldn't find it. But I made a small check before I should get back. Found it. And it was amazing, and the ordering of coffee at the Starbucks was also great. "Caffe Latte", and then everyone called it in serialzed. The staff told me I couldn't photo the crossing, but a small quick one I managed.
Quickly back to the hotel. Everyone needed to validate their TrainTicket, and we all went together to the station. My roomie had my ticket. Lucky me!
As the validating was trival we all chose to convine at a later date, I hadn't packed so I went to my room and fixed that. Then a small group wanted to meet and have some drinks in the Skybar, 30 stories above ground. The drinks weren't that amazing.
Then we were off to the restaurant, after a short waiting session, we walked to the restaurant. Located in the basement of a building across the Swinagawa train station, and while we were waiting for seating, a very drunk Japanese buisnessman struck up conversation. He was very helpful and funny, but I'm not sure how his fellow buisness-friends liked that interaction.
Once we were seated, the ordering commenced. Our Orderer tried to fix food for everyone, but everyone were not okay with that. And that created alot of confusion with waiters and our selfs, the Manager showed up, and after some waiving of arms, everything was sorted out. (I believe that he wanted to check with the Orderer that everything was under control, as other people ordered food than him.)  No one in the restaurant spoke any english, that made it that much more difficult.
The food was varied and very good. The beer was also drinkable.
After the food some people wanted to find more stuff to do. I was for a few minutes on that train, but since I saw who were in that I gang, The real hardcore, I declined when I saw someone who wanted to take a drink at the Hotel. A drink isn't the same thing as an allnighter...
The hotel bar was very slow getting me my "hoto sake".
