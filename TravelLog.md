This is the README.md FILE and it's pretty awesome

==================================================

1) Initial thoughts.

I wonder what I will learn in the land of Tokyo.


==================================================

2) The Pre trip
The trip has begun. I'm heading to the Terminal 5 Arlanda... Sitting and coding on the train I'm early to the Terminal. An hour before all other traverlers will arrivie.
I'm alone on the train... Isn't anyone going this early abroad?
Arrived at the airport.
Just managed to commit my changes before the trains closed. Alias is difficult to setup! :)

The checking-in. The Automate wasn't my fiend and I was helped by a NICE LADY at the counter. It is possible that some people are naturally nice. Found a red lounge area where the poweroutlets where freely availible. Who new that the red sofa corner was this nice at Arlanda...
Waiting for the rest of the crue.

After experiencing the red room of power outlets, I make the trek to the Passport/security line, I wait for zero minutes before I can put my stuff into the plastic tray. On the other side I randomly strol around until I find two happy travels that will join me to Tokyo. One is eating Hamburgers and I'm not the one to say know. MAX has open in Arlanda, and those burgers are GOOD. After some eating a fellow old friend have joined us, we discuss the merits of diffrent games to have on our laptops/devices.

We join the other group that has stopped at the Beer place. The group is complete for a few minutes, after which people went their seperate way. I'm left with my roomie and two other guys, they are planing the day we arriave. A cost-play event in Tokyo happens every Sunday, that is the thing that looks most promising. Sailermoon characters are promised... The Brooklyn lager was very good. We rush to make s short hello to the people that are of to Dubai, they are talking about iOS stuff. Interesting, but I want my HTML5/JS thingy.
I  make a short congratulations to the Red Socks dude... Fist bump!

Then I ran to my groups waterhole, and managed to take a pint of Brooklyn before it was time to board.

Writing this on the plane. There is a choice of Sandwich Chicken or Salad. I hope that I will get my Chicken one. 30 minutes to Kastup, that's the airport of Copenhagen. Beer awaits... 10 hours to a Costplay event! Weird.

Made some basic test to my hello world application. 
Had a glass of water. Thanks SAS! You are too kind...
Now going down for landing to Kastrup. My ears are making there presence known.

First leg: DONE, uneventful, no sandwich...
=========================================================
Pause in Copenhagen.

Talked a bit about the merits of clocks, then entusiast won. Went through another passport control, I'm still me.
Short walk until the last beer in Denmark, I got two of those. One was given to me by a kind soul. Discussions about the population in Tokyo, an export setteled that line of thought, none of our guides had that information. The beer was Carlsberg, the best beer in the world, probably not.

==========================================================

The flight to Nippon.

The normal safety guide had a bonus. "Please don't sleep in the aile." A new one.
One of the files that I was supposed to view was broken. Weird. I thought that USB-sticks where eternal! My roomie is sleeping already, and my bench buddy is watching Elasyum. I will be watching my The Daily Show as always. 
One short commit on the Flight and I will be happy...

The travel proceeds. We are over Helsinki...

Over the mighty land of Russia. Eaten the food of air. It was especial good given the normal state of the air food.

Interesting discussions with my lane buddy.

Just passed the Ural Mountains. I'm over Siberia...

On the map I can see Tokyo, still five hours left....
Sleept a bit.
Tried watching Ghost in a Shell, but couldn't get through it. The subtitles where too much.

Last hour of the flight, getting a sandwich after some hours of sleep and watching parts of Wolverine, but the now we are over the Ocean. Last stretch.
Tired. But not too bad.

=========================
Landing in Tokyo.
a) Waiting for the tickets.
b) To the hotel and en exellent lunch experience.
c) To the park and the missing Manga people
d) Back to the Hotel
e) The restaurant experience
=========================
Start of the course

After some wired problems with travel. 
The Tokyo trafic was more difficult than expected. Alot of people on the Subway.

First lunch on our own. AMAZING!
We hade some problems ordering food, but managed somehow got the most amazing lunch. Boild food at the table, pork and scrimp. Schumi schumi. We learned how to prepare our food, once we left the place. 1200 yes. I laught until I cried about missed how we should eat our food.
